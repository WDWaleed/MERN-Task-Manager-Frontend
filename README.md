# MERN Task Manager

This is a project I've been working on ever since I finished frontend web dev. This was the last frontend project I created before I moved on to learning MERN for full-stack web dev.
Recently, (March 2025) I've learned the basics of MERN and now I'm applying that knowledge to turn this frontend project into a full-stack one. I've already added basic CRUD funtionality but there are still many things I plan to add.

- Chore: onSuccess and onError of React Query are deprecated. Do something about them. Use onSettled if that isn't deprecated. Btw, these do exist for useMutation, just not for useQuery
